We followed the tutorial here:
[youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFDWs_DG2QY&index=2&list=PLuteWQUGtU9BcXXr3jCG00uVXFwQJkLRa)

Ground control station (laptop) is remote linked to raspberry pi which is receiving flight telemetries from ardupilot running on PX4.

Run precise_landing.py to land on ArUco Marker

With the price money($1000 in amazon gift card), here is my own drone: https://rotorbuilds.com/build/18772
